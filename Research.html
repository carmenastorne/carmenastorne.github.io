						Are Changes of Major Major Changes? The Roles of Grades,
						Gender, and Preferences in College
						Major Switching (with Jamin D. Speer),
						<i>Economics of Education Review</i>, 2019.
					</a>
				</h4>

				<p>
					The choice of college major is a key stage in the career
					search, and over a third of college
					students switch majors at least once. We provide the first
					comprehensive analysis of major
					switching, looking at the patterns of switching in both
					academic and non-academic dimensions. Low
					grades signal academic mismatch and predict switching majors
					- and the lower the grades, the
					larger the switch in terms of course content. Surprisingly,
					these switches do not improve students'
					grades. When students switch majors, they switch to majors
					that "look like them": females to
					female-heavy majors, and so on. Lower-ability women flee
					competitive majors at high rates, while
					men and higher-ability women are undeterred. Women are far
					more likely to leave STEM fields for
					majors that are less competitive - but still somewhat
					science-intensive - suggesting that
					leaving STEM may be more about fleeing the "culture" of STEM
					majors than fleeing science
					and math.

						Advertising for Consideration (with Joaquin Lopez and

					</a>
				</h4>

				<p>
					We analyze markets where firms competing on price advertise
					to increase the probability of entering
					consumers' consideration sets. We find that moderately
					costly advertising allows firms to raise
					prices and possibly profits by reducing the fraction of
					price-conscious consumers, and by segmenting
					the market according to whether or not consumers consider
					the lower priced firm. However, when the
					cost of advertising is sufficiently low, advertising leads
					to a prisoners' dilemma that adversely
					impacts profits without affecting expected prices.

						An empirical investigation on the transfer of

						<i>Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics</i>,
						2019.
					</a>
				</h4>

				<p>
					We study the use of expatriates in transferring knowledge
					within a multinational corporation (MNC).
					We argue that MNCs use expatriates to allocate knowledge
					between headquarters and its foreign
					affiliates. With data from MNCs headquartered in South
					Korea, we trace unobservable knowledge using
					observable labour mobility. Our empirical analysis shows
					that the use of expatriates increases as
					communication between South Korea and the host country
					becomes more costly. However, the extent to
					which the use of expatriates relates with communication
					costs decreases in the sectoral complexity.

						Drop out, switch majors, or persist? The contrasting

						<i>Economics Letters</i>, 2018.
					</a>
				</h4>

				<p>
					Men and women respond differently to early-college
					struggles. Men are more likely than women to drop
					out of college, while women are more likely to switch
					majors. These effects offset so that there is
					no gender gap in the probability of graduating in one's
					initial major choice. For students who begin
					in STEM majors, however, women are far less likely to
					graduate in the field, driven by the fact that
					they are twice as likely to switch majors. We find no
					evidence that women are more sensitive to poor
					academic performance in the switching or dropout decisions.

				</h4>

				<p>
					We explore asymmetries in the way consumers sample prices in
					a simple sequential search framework.
					In equilibrium, the price distribution of a firm catering to
					more local consumers first-order
					stochastically dominates that of its rival. Prices rise in
					the degree of asymmetry. (Extended

						Production Hierarchies and MNC Expatriates (with
						Joonhyung Lee)
					</a>
				</h4>

				<p>
					We study the adjustment of knowledge for an expanding MNC
					through the lens of a knowledge hierarchy
					model. In particular, based on the recent evidence that
					expatriates serve as a means for knowledge
					transmission from MNCs to their foreign affiliates, we
					investigate how the use of expatriates
					changes when foreign affiliates expand or contract. Using
					data on labor mobility for MNCs
					headquartered in South Korea, we analyze foreign affiliates
					that expand with and without changing
					their organization of hierarchical layers. We find that
					foreign affiliates who expand by changing
					their number of organizational layers require more
					expatriates, especially at the higher layers.
					When affiliates expand by adding an organizational layer,
					the new layer mostly comprises
					expatriates, while the need for expatriates in the layer
					immediately below declines. Similarly, when
					affiliates contract by dropping a layer, the need for
					expatriates in the layer immediately below
					increases. Additionally, when affiliates grow without adding
					a layer, the span of control at the
					upper layer(s) increases. These results are consistent with
					the predictions of the knowledge
					hierarchy model. </p>

						Expectations and Follow-Through: The Roles of Confidence
						and Non-Cognitive Skills for Self-Employment (with
						Andrew Hussey and Daniel Mangrum)
					</a>
				</h4>
				<p>
					We examine the predictors of both long-term expectations of
					self-employment and future
					self-employment activities and earnings among the same
					individuals, with a particular focus on
					gender differences and the roles of non-cognitive skills.
					Using longitudinal data from the GMAT
					Registrant Survey, which includes prospective graduate
					management students, our analysis involves
					wide-ranging and novel sets of variables, including
					work-life balance and job preferences,
					self-efficacy, confidence, and other non-cognitive skills or
					characteristics. We find notable
					differences in the drivers of self-employment and
					self-employment expectations between men and
					women, and also large differences in the set of variables
					that relate to self-employment intentions
					versus future self-employment outcomes. While preferences
					for work-life balance matter more for
					men's expectations, preferences about non-monetary
					characteristics of the job, such as job security
					and interesting work, matter more for women. In contrast,
					regarding actual self-employment, only
					non-cognitive skills play a substantial role for women,
					while men are driven mostly by preferences
					over work-life balance. Confidence in one's quantitative
					skills influences self- employment
					decisions, especially for women, and it also affects success
					in both the self-employed and the
					traditionally employed sectors, as reflected in earnings.
