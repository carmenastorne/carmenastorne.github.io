      <h3>  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/lpxy0ognnq7ed5j/MajorChanges_10-27-16.pdf?dl=0" target="_new">Are Changes of Major Major Changes? The Roles of Grades, Gender, and Preferences in College Major Switching </a> <span style="font-size:14pt">(with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jaminspeer/" target="_new">Jamin Speer </a>)</span></h3>
      <p>
      Almost half of college students switch majors at least once, suggesting that college major choice is a process rather than a single decision. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of major switching, modeling the choice process as a complex matching  problem  between  student  and  major.   Students have abilities and preferences, while majors have both academic course requirements and nonacademic characteristics such as competitiveness and gender makeup. We first show that low grades serve as a signal of academic mismatch.  Low grades predict switching majors - and the lower the grades, the "larger" the switch in academic terms.  When students switch majors, their grades improve - and the larger the switch, the greater the improvement.  Academics are only one factor in major switches, however.  Overwhelmingly, when students switch majors, they are drawn  to  majors  that  "look  like  them":   females  to  female-heavy  majors, blacks to black-heavy majors, and so on.  Part of the major choice process seems to be finding one's preferred peer group.  Women also flee competitive majors - especially STEM majors - at much higher rates than men.  Women who leave STEM switch to majors that  are  much  less  male-dominated,  suggesting  that leaving STEM is more about fleeing the culture and makeup of STEM majors than it is about fleeing science.<p>
      
      
      
      
            <h3> An empirical investigation on the transfer of expatriates within MNCs from a knowledge perspective <span style="font-size:14pt">(with Joonhyung Lee )<span> </h3> 
       
      <p>We study the transfer of expatriates as a channel through which a MNC endows foreign affiliates with knowledge. We use data on labor mobility of MNCs headquartered in South Korea. Because of the tacit nature of knowledge and the unique Korean characteristics, unobservable knowledge can be traced by observable labor mobility. We first document that foreign affiliates located in countries that incur a higher communication costs with Korea use more Korean expatriates. We then investigate how changes in the utilization of expatriates are associated with the foreign affiliates 's expansion through the lens of a knowledge hierarchy model that allows firms to grow with and without reorganizing. Employees are classified into at most three hierarchical layers. We find that the foreign affiliates that expand without reorganizing require more Korean expatriates, especially at the higher layers. When the affiliates expand by adding a layer, it mostly comprises Korean expatriates. The need for Korean expatriates at the layer immediately below declines because its knowledge is more substitutable with that of the new layer. When affiliates drop a layer, however, the need for Korean expatriates at the immediately lower layer significantly increases.</p>
      
      
                  <h3 > Advertising and Pricing When Attention is Limited <span style="font-size:14pt">(with Joaquin Lopez and Aleksandr Yankelevich)</span></h3> 
      
      <p>We construct a simple model of consumer limited attention that has a number of desirable properties. Foremost, our model offers an explanation for price dispersion in homogeneous good markets in the absence of search costs (e.g., when search costs are sunk). Moreover, there is a unique symmetric price distribution that changes from marginal cost to monopoly pricing as attention becomes more limited. We additionally allow firms to influence consumer attention by advertising. When the cost of advertising is low, advertising leads firms to a prisoner's dilemma that adversely impacts profits, but not prices. However, moderately costly advertising could lead firms to effectively fight for attention and raise prices.</p>
      
      
                        <h3>The Entrepreneurial Personality of Aspiring Business Professionals: Expectations and Actual Self Employment<span style="font-size:14pt"> (with Andrew Hussey and Daniel Mangrum)</span></h3> 
   
      <p>We examine the characteristics of individuals who expect to be self-employed in the future, as well as the predictors of actual future self-employment among the same individuals. Using longitudinal data from the GMAT Registrant Survey, our analysis involves wide-ranging, novel sets of variables, representing hard skills, non-cognitive skills and characteristics, job and life- related preferences, education-related debt, and over- and underconfidence. With emphasis on gender differences, we highlight the common and uncommon drivers of expected-versus-actual self-employment. We find substantial differences across gender and between plans and follow- through. For example, while highly talented, overconfident and attractive women tend to expect self-employment, only those with a particular set of non-cognitive skills are likely to become self- employed in the future. Job-related preferences jointly predict self-employment expectations for both males and females, and as more traditional human capital-related variables are drivers of realized self-employment for men, non-cognitive characteristics are not.</p>
      
      <h3> Kin Targeted Altruism with Noise</h4> 
      <p>Can pure altruism generate strategic altruism when kin recognition is noisy? This paper studies a prisoners' dilemma played between two people who exhibit altruistic preferences towards kin. The probability that a player's opponent is kin is common knowledge. Instead of observing the degree of relatedness with the other player, each player observes a noisy private signal. When the game is played once, players cooperate only with those identified as kin. However, when the prisoners' dilemma is played for two periods instead of one, uncertainty about relatedness brings strategic considerations into the game even if the odds of being related are small. De- pending on the parameters, there are Perfect Bayesian Equilibria in which players cooperate in the first round even after getting a negative kin signal. Since a player can make inferences about her opponentâ€™s signal based on first period actions, a non-relative mimics kin to induce cooperation in the second period.</p>
